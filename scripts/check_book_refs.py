"""Dependency-free link/asset checker for the mojo-gpu-puzzles book.

mdbook / mdbook-linkcheck are not guaranteed to be available, so this is a
stdlib-only validator (Python 3.10+) that walks the book's Markdown sources and
verifies that every local link and image target resolves to a file that exists.

Resolution rules (derived from the verified build topology):

  * English book builds ``book/src`` -> ``book/html`` with assets copied
    adjacent to their sources, so English pages use relative paths.
  * Korean book builds ``book/i18n/ko/src`` -> ``book/html/ko``, but the ko
    source tree contains ZERO media files. Korean pages therefore reference
    assets via site-absolute paths (``/puzzle_NN/media/...``) that resolve at
    the site root, which the ENGLISH source tree mirrors once built.

Two kinds of references are extracted from each ``*.md`` file:
  (a) Markdown links/images ``[text](target)`` and ``![alt](target)``.
  (b) HTML ``<img src="target">`` tags.

Each non-skipped target is resolved as follows:
  * ``http(s)://`` / ``mailto:`` / pure ``#anchor`` targets are skipped.
  * ``{{#include ...}}`` directives are skipped (different resolution model).
  * Fenced code blocks (``` ``` ```) and inline code spans (`` `...` ``) are
    stripped first: per CommonMark, links/images do not parse inside code, and
    these pages contain code like ``out.tile[size](id)`` that otherwise looks
    like a Markdown link.
  * A site-absolute target (starts with ``/``) resolves against ``book/src``
    (the English source tree, which mirrors the built site root) for BOTH
    English and Korean files.
  * A relative target resolves against the directory of the ``.md`` file within
    its own source tree (en -> book/src, ko -> book/i18n/ko/src).
  * ``#fragments`` and ``?query`` suffixes are stripped before resolution.

Exits nonzero and lists ``file:line  ->  target`` for every unresolved
reference; exits 0 with a summary count when everything resolves.
