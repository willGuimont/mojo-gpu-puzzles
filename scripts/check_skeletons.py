"""Check that problem skeletons stay in sync with their solutions.

The repository's teaching contract is: a file under ``problems/pNN/`` must be
identical to its ``solutions/pNN/`` counterpart *except* that

1. each ``# ANCHOR: NAME`` / ``# ANCHOR_END: NAME`` marker gains a ``_solution``
   suffix on the solution side (the book includes both via mdBook
   ``{{#include ...:NAME}}`` / ``...:NAME_solution}}`` directives), and
2. the implementation inside each pedagogical region is replaced, on the problem
   side, by one or more ``# FILL ...`` hint comments.

In other words, solving a puzzle should only ever *add* lines. If a problem
contains real (non-``# FILL``) code that does not appear in the solution, the
two have drifted -- which is exactly the bug tracked in issue #254, where the
LayoutTensor -> TileTensor migration updated solutions but left the skeletons on
the old API.

This script flags every drifted pair. It is read-only and exits non-zero when
any pair is out of sync, so it can gate CI.
