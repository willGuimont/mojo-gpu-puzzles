# Puzzle 23: GPU Functional Programming Patterns

## Overview

**Part VI: Mojo Functional Patterns and Benchmarking** introduces Mojo's
high-level programming patterns for GPU computation. You'll learn functional
approaches that automatically handle vectorization, memory optimization, and
performance tuning, replacing manual GPU kernel programming.

**Key insight:** _Modern GPU programming doesn't require sacrificing elegance
for performance - Mojo's functional patterns give you both._

## What you'll learn

### **GPU execution hierarchy**

Understand the fundamental relationship between GPU threads and SIMD operations:

```text
GPU Device
├── Grid (your entire problem)
│   ├── Block 1 (group of threads, shared memory)
│   │   ├── Warp 1 (32 threads, lockstep execution) --> We'll learn in Part VII
│   │   │   ├── Thread 1 → SIMD
│   │   │   ├── Thread 2 → SIMD
│   │   │   └── ... (32 threads total)
│   │   └── Warp 2 (32 threads)
│   └── Block 2 (independent group)
```

**What Mojo abstracts for you:**

- Grid/Block configuration automatically calculated
- Warp management handled transparently
- Thread scheduling optimized automatically
- Memory hierarchy optimization built-in

💡 **Note**: While this Part focuses on functional patterns,
**warp-level programming** and advanced GPU memory management will be covered in
detail in **[Part VII](../puzzle_24/puzzle_24.md)**.

### **Four fundamental patterns**

Learn the complete spectrum of GPU functional programming:

1. **Elementwise**: Maximum parallelism with automatic SIMD vectorization
2. **Tiled**: Memory-efficient processing with cache optimization
3. **Manual vectorization**: Expert-level control over SIMD operations
4. **Mojo vectorize**: Safe, automatic vectorization with bounds checking

### **Performance patterns you'll recognize**

```text
Problem: Add two 1024-element vectors (SIZE=1024, SIMD_WIDTH=4)

Elementwise:     256 threads × 1 SIMD op     = High parallelism
Tiled:           32 threads  × 32 scalar ops = Cache optimization
Manual:          8 threads   × 32 SIMD ops   = Maximum control
Mojo vectorize:  32 threads  × 8 SIMD ops    = Automatic safety
```

### 📊 **Real performance insights**

Learn to interpret empirical benchmark results:

```text
Benchmark Results (SIZE=1,048,576):
elementwise:        0.005ms  ← Coalesced access and maximum parallelism win
vectorized:         0.149ms  ← Automatic vectorization, some bandwidth lost
tiled:              0.260ms  ← Uncoalesced access with single-element loads
manual_vectorized:  0.585ms  ← Uncoalesced access plus complex indexing
```

## Prerequisites

Before diving into functional patterns, ensure you're comfortable with:

- **Basic GPU concepts**: Memory hierarchy, thread execution, SIMD operations
- **Mojo fundamentals**: Parameter functions, compile-time specialization,
  closure capture semantics
- **TileTensor operations**: Loading, storing, and tensor manipulation
- **GPU memory management**: Buffer allocation, host-device synchronization

## Learning path

### **1. Elementwise operations**

**→ [Elementwise - Basic GPU Functional Operations](./elementwise.md)**

Start with the foundation: automatic thread management and SIMD vectorization.

**What you'll learn:**

- Functional GPU programming with `elementwise`
- Automatic SIMD vectorization within GPU threads
- TileTensor operations for safe memory access
- Capture semantics in nested closures

**Key pattern:**

```mojo
elementwise[simd_width=SIMD_WIDTH, target="gpu"](add_function, Coord(total_size), ctx)
```

### **2. Tiled processing**

**→ [Tile - Memory-Efficient Tiled Processing](./tile.md)**

Build on elementwise with memory-optimized tiling patterns.

**What you'll learn:**

- Tile-based memory organization for cache optimization
- Sequential SIMD processing within tiles
- Memory locality principles and cache-friendly access patterns
- Thread-to-tile mapping vs thread-to-element mapping

**Key insight:** Tiling trades parallel breadth for memory locality - fewer
threads each doing more work with better cache utilization.

### **3. Advanced vectorization**

**→ [Vectorization - Fine-Grained SIMD Control](./vectorize.md)**

Explore manual control and automatic vectorization strategies.

**What you'll learn:**

- Manual SIMD operations with explicit index management
- Mojo's vectorize function for safe, automatic vectorization
- Chunk-based memory organization for optimal SIMD alignment
- Performance trade-offs between manual control and safety

**Two approaches:**

- **Manual**: Direct control, maximum performance, complex indexing
- **Mojo vectorize**: Automatic optimization, built-in safety, clean code

### 🧠 **4. Threading vs SIMD concepts**

**→ [GPU Threading vs SIMD - Understanding the Execution
Hierarchy](./gpu-thread-vs-simd.md)**

Understand the fundamental relationship between parallelism levels.

**What you'll learn:**

- GPU threading hierarchy and hardware mapping
- SIMD operations within GPU threads
- Pattern comparison and thread-to-work mapping
- Choosing the right pattern for different workloads

**Key insight:** GPU threads provide the parallelism structure, while SIMD
operations provide the vectorization within each thread.

### 📊 **5. Performance benchmarking in Mojo**

**→ [Benchmarking in Mojo](./benchmarking.md)**

Learn to measure, analyze, and optimize GPU performance scientifically.

**What you'll learn:**

- Mojo's built-in benchmarking framework
- GPU-specific timing and synchronization challenges
- Parameterized benchmark functions with compile-time specialization
- Empirical performance analysis and pattern selection

**Critical technique:** Using `keep()` to prevent compiler optimization of
benchmarked code.

## Getting started

Start with the elementwise pattern and work through each section systematically.
Each puzzle builds on the previous concepts while introducing new levels of
sophistication.

💡 **Success tip**: Focus on understanding the **why** behind each pattern, not
just the **how**. The conceptual framework you develop here will serve you
throughout your GPU programming career.

**Learning objective**: By the end of Part VI, you'll think in terms of
functional patterns rather than low-level GPU mechanics, enabling you to write
more maintainable, performant, and portable GPU code.

**Begin with**: **[Elementwise Operations](./elementwise.md)** to discover
functional GPU programming.
